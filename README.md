The application allows users to filter a curated database of design inspirations by:
-   High-level sustainability goals (Tier 1 Strategies)
-   Specific design approaches (Tier 2 Strategies)
-   Creative ideation methods (SCAMPER)
-   Real-world case studies

This tool is intended to serve as a source of inspiration and a practical aid for integrating sustainable principles into the design process.
